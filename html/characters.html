                longDesc: "Mouha ou Hammou Zayani was a remarkable tribal leader who led the Zayan confederation in resisting French colonial expansion into the Middle Atlas mountains. His strategic brilliance in mountain warfare and ability to unite various tribes made him a formidable opponent. He maintained the independence of his region for many years through a combination of military resistance and diplomatic negotiations. His legacy continues to inspire Amazigh pride and identity in the Middle Atlas region.",
